# FBREF_Scraper
Webscraper for FBREF that can get indiivudal player performances for all the teams within any league for any season. Also contains a function that can aggregate the individual player stats back to a team level. Used that in an ML project to see whether it is worth it to make predictions based on only the players who would also play in a game.
